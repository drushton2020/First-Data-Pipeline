# First-Data-Pipeline

This project is from my professional development using dataquest. The aim was to build a fully fledged data pipeline using a JSON file, which is from the Hacker News API. 

Prior to completing this guided project I learned the following concepts:
* Functional Programming 
* Creating Pipeline Tasks
* Building a Pipeline Class
* Multiple Dependency Pipeline
